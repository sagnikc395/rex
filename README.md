# rex ðŸ¦–

a smol r(eg)ex (haha so funny !) engine written in Go.

## motivation 

wanted to make something smol and useful that I can use for my daily tasks and find patterns in my notes.

also planning to add a regex engine in [monkey](https://github.com/sagnikc395/monkey), and I wanted to make something from scratch , rather than use go's inbuilt regexp.
