# rex ðŸ¦–

a smol r(eg)ex (haha so funny !) engine written in Python.

## motivation

wanted to make something smol and useful that I can use for my daily tasks and find patterns in my notes.

also planning to add a regex engine in [vanara](https://github.com/sagnikc395/vanara), and I wanted to make something from scratch.
